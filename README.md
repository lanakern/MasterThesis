# MasterThesis

This GitHub repository is established to track the progress of my master thesis. In my thesis I analyze the impact of sports participation on cogntive and non-cognitive skills of university students in Germany. To do so, I use observational panel data from the National Educational Panel Study. The methodological approach is based on the Double Machine Learning estimator proposed by Victor Chernozhukov et al. (2018). I hand-code the procedure in R.

- The "Scripts" folder contains all R scripts needed to replicate the analysis.
- The "Functions" folder contains all hand-coded functions which are used in the R scripts.
- The html file "Thesis_Documentation.htm" contains detailed information about the confounding factors used in this analysis as well as the data preparation process. I recommend to open this file in a Web Browser.

Unfortunately, I am not allowed to publish the data.
